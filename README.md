# xbox-series-x-finder
Script to locate and notify subscribers of an available Xbox Series X. Can be easily modified to track any item.

The Gamestop, BestBuy and Walmart functions use Google Chrome with Selenium and the Target function makes use of an API I found while looking at the network activity on their website.

After running this script 24/7 for two days, we were able to locate and purchase an Xbox Series X!
